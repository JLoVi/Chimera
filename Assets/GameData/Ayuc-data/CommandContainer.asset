  sequenceOne:
  - 'Down in the valley '
  - 'Into the arid expanse '
  - 'I found a snake burrowing '
  - 'The skin shedding from its back '
  - 'It fell softly on the ground '
  - 'Useless, it was '
  - 'And all the more precious '
  - 'For it carried no body '
  - 'That might dissolve '
  - 'But quietly it awaited eternity '
  - 'Unbothered by worries '
  - 'Of changes that might occur '
  - 'A body turned tunnel '
  - 'There '
  - 'I saw it '
  - 'And to bother its immortality '
  - 'I blew it away '
  sequenceTwo:
  - 'In the open '
  - 'That must remain open '
  - 'You '
  - 'You told us '
  - "\u2013 Or was it me? \u2013 "
  - 'That even a pebble contained it '
  - 'From every point '
  - 'We could have accessed the mountain '
  - 'By looking deep enough '
  - 'Or rather through desire alone '
  - 'Of the kind that burns without being consumed '
  - 'We believed you '
  - 'But desire burns only a minute '
  - "Then, it\u2019s just the job of remembering "
  - "Until it\u2019s gone "
  - "Until it\u2019s back "
  - 'The Mount Analogus '
  sequenceThree:
  - 'They were in line '
  - 'Like a sequence of numbers '
  - 'Awaiting they stood '
  - 'Some left, impatient, to venture '
  - 'Perhaps looking for the best '
  - 'Among the available destinies '
  - 'A pile of them, scattered over the floor '
  - ' In that place between times '
  - 'Some promised fortunes '
  - 'Others suggested a mild excitement '
  - 'The youngest went running at the signal '
  - 'To catch their prey '
  - 'Only a few remained '
  - 'And they walked slowly '
  - 'Searching among the leftovers '
  - 'A quiet life '
  - 'A destiny beloved by fate '
  sequenceFour:
  - 'There it goes, the monster '
  - 'White sprays announce its passage '
  - 'White geysers from the hidden life, endlessly '
  - 'Gurgling and dreaming under the sea '
  - 'There we see it '
  - 'And the steer on the quarterdeck remains still, '
  - 'Stupefied and frozen like a limb '
  - 'Not so the monster '
  - 'Its armour as lucid as skin, rugged like the mountains '
  - 'For every scar, a story, another ship '
  - 'Like ours, perhaps exactly our own '
  - 'Another captain, like ours '
  - 'With muscles of steel and nerves of rope '
  - 'Sails for eyelids and all that belongs '
  - 'To those who stand on the threshold of reality '
  - 'Like the monster itself, sailing '
  - 'on a spray of desire over the sea '
